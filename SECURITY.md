# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Supported Versions

We aim to support the latest minor release line:

- 0.1.x – actively supported

Older versions may receive fixes at the maintainer’s discretion.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately so we can triage and fix them before public disclosure.

Preferred channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisories: create a private report to the maintainers
2. Email: ScottKostolni@gmail.com

What to include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce and/or proof‑of‑concept
- Affected versions and environment details
- Your contact information for follow‑up

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide regular status updates as we investigate.

Please avoid creating public GitHub issues for security reports.
